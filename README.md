Week Six Homework

This is a Holiday Gif Generator! In this assignment, we were to use JQuery, Javascript, and API calls to Giphy to dynamically generate a set of Gifs. I decided to use vanilla CSS for this assignment to get more experience with positioning, etc.

When interacting with the page, you can add other holidays you like to the bank of pre-programmed buttons. Once you click on a holiday, 10 random gifs are generated for it.

To make the gifs animate, you can click on them. To pause them, just click a second time.

Add some more of your favorite holidays!
